If you are upgrading from 0.9.2.3 for 1.3.5, please use steam to "verify integrity of game files" before attempting to install.

To install tModLoader, simply run the tModLoaderInstaller.jar file. Java 1.7 or higher is required for the installer to run. The installer will make a window pop up, informing you of either success or failure.

If the installer for some reason does not work, or if you do not want to install/upgrade Java, you may also do a manual install.  You may wish to back-up your vanilla Terraria.exe first.

1.  Go to your Terraria's Steam folder (the one containing Terraria.exe).  For older installations of Steam, this will be "~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Terraria".  For newer installations of Steam, this will be "~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Terraria".

2.  Copy all of these files into that folder.
